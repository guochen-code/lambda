power tuning deploy url:
https://serverlessrepo.aws.amazon.com/applications/arn:aws:serverlessrepo:us-east-1:451282441545:applications~aws-lambda-power-tuning

go to step functions
find powerTuningStateMachine which is created by the above url
click start execution
need to provide input:
{
    "lambdaARN": "<your-lambda-function-arn>", # copy your lambda function arn and paste here
    "powerValues": [128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 3008],
    "num": 10,
    "payload": "{}",
    "parallelInvocation": true,
    "strategy": "cost"
}
click start execution

go to step output tab. copy the https link under "visualization" key word
paste into a web browser. you can see the plots

pro tips
can use step functions one more time for a narro range
for example from above we know the optimal value is between 512 and 1024, you can set a new range between 512 and 1024 to test with
