x-ray tracing
- application level debugging feature
- generates trace information on your invocations
- visualization aid for udnerstanding how much time is spent where
- you can add custom segments to your code for function traces (how long one portion of code takes like http calls)

pro tips
- expensive
$5 per 1 million traces recorded
$0.05 per 1 million traces retrieved
$0.05 per 1 million traces scanned
- more useful for ad-hoc debugging (turn on for a short period for debugging)
- consider using sampling (sample 10% of your data)
