(1) download to current folder
windows: pip install -t $PWD aws-xray-sdk
(MAC: pip install -t . aws-xray-sdk)

(2) zip the download
(2.1) create a new directory called python # lambda needs to know which language this denpendency is with references to, layers are scoped to particular languages
      and copy&paste all the downloaded files into this new directory
(2.2) zip this python directory

(3) create layer
go back to lambda console - go to layers sections on the left menu - create layer
- Name: x-ray - upload a zip file - x86_64 (arm64 is a new thing, not sure if the dependency will work on that) - compatible runtime: python3.8 
- click create - 10.3MB file would take a few seconds

(4) attach layer to lambda function
go to lambda function - add a layer - choose a layer: custom layers - select the layer just created: x-ray 
(if not see your custom lay, check if the runtime python versions are matched between your function and layer) - choose version - click add
