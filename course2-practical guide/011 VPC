in order to communicate with MSK, need to be set up in the same VPC

lambda security:

--- provide AmazonVPCFullAccess to the lambda execution role
go to permission - open role name url - add permissions dropdown menu - choose attach policy - choose AmazonVPCFullAccess

--- configure VPC for lambda (choose both subnets and provide the security group of MSK cluster)
go to VPC - edit - choose the vpc - choose all the subnets - security group: choose the MSK security group - save
